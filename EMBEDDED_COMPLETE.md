## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Shopify OAuth Flow**
```typescript
// 1. Initiate OAuth
GET /api/auth?shop=example.myshopify.com

// 2. User approves in Shopify
Redirect to: https://example.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/authorize

// 3. Handle callback
GET /api/auth/callback?code=xxx&hmac=xxx&shop=example.myshopify.com

// 4. Exchange code for access token
POST https://example.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/access_token

// 5. Store token and redirect to embedded app
Redirect to: https://example.myshopify.com/admin/apps/api_key
```

### **App Bridge Integration**
```typescript
// Initialize App Bridge
const app = createApp({
  apiKey: process.env.SHOPIFY_API_KEY,
  shop: shop,
  host: host,
})

// Handle embedded redirect
const redirect = Redirect.create(app)
redirect.dispatch(Redirect.Action.REMOTE, appUrl)
```

### **Token Management**
```typescript
// Shared token storage across API routes
class TokenStorage {
  private tokens = new Map<string, string>()
  
  setToken(shop: string, token: string) { /* ... */ }
  getToken(shop: string) { /* ... */ }
  removeToken(shop: string) { /* ... */ }
}
```

### **Product Import Flow**
```typescript
// 1. Fetch from Azan API
GET https://beta.azanwholesale.com/api/en/products/by-api

// 2. Create in Shopify
POST https://SHOP/admin/api/2024-01/products.json

// 3. Sync inventory via webhooks
POST /api/webhooks/orders (when orders are placed)
```
